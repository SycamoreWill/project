        <p>&nbspLeague of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena where players take control of a character called a champion, and are matched with and against other players in teams. As of December 13, 2013, there are 117 different Champions from which to choose from. Players meet up usually in "lanes", and gain levels from killing the opposing team's Champions controlled by players and Minions that regularly spawn and attack the other team. The player earns a small amount of gold passively, but gets more by killing minions, towers that guard the lanes, and neutral monsters. With this gold, they can buy items to strengthen their champion for the duration of the game. On the classic Summoners Rift map, the game is ended by destroying the last structure on the map, the enemies' "Nexus". Other maps have variations of rules and objectives, such as Dominion where the team's Nexus will lose health when the opposing team has at least three of the five towers in their control. </p>

        <p>&nbsp In League of Legends there are three lanes where the two opposing teams must fight each other. Since there are five players, the top and bottom lanes will generally be two on two's whereas the middle lane is generally a one on one. The lane phase is very crucial in the development of your champions development as its the phase where the main goal is to gain experience and gold via last hitting enemy minions. It is important that all champions be "farmed" enough to be able to stand tall in the inevitable team fights, and therefore it is imperative that communication is kept up between allies. An example is that the play in solo mid can't focus on what the other four opponents are doing and needs to be informed of their potential moves against him/her.</p>

        <p>&nbspAn item is an artifact or object carried by champions to enhance their performance on the Fields of Justice. A champion can only carry six items at a time, making the selection of items an important part of achieving victory. Items are only obtainable through the item shop located at the resurrection platform. This is also where items are sold back for 70% of the total gold spent to obtain them. The exceptions to this are the Prospector, Doran, & Gold Income items, Consumables, and  Guardian Angel, which return 40% of their total cost.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1) Composition of each team. Examples of questions to consider: Do we have a tank? Who initiates? Who can peel for our carries? How should we fight (poke, keep spread out, chain AOE, constant engage and disengage)?</li>           
            <li>2) Threats on each team. Examples of questions to consider: Who do we protect? How do we protect? Who must we target? How can we get to their carry?</li>
            <li>3) Position of allies and enemies. Examples of questions to consider: Do we have stronger teammates in position to fight compared to the enemy? Is a key enemy out of position? Where is best for us to fight? Should we just zone an enemy carry rather than try kill him?</li>
            <p>&nbspConstantly adapt to these factors to win each fight. There is never one thing to always do in a team fight other than win it.</p>
